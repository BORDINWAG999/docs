{% tip %}

**Tip**: If you opened a Plus request with the wrong base branch, rather than closing it out and opening a new one, you can instead change the base branch. For more information, see "[Changing the base branch of a pull request](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request)."
